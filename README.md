# README

This is a project done for my *Visual Poetics and Narratives* class, which is more of an art class than a programming class. I wanted to do something that utilized familiar UI elements in a new way, so I used my knowledge of web development and the Bootstrap library to put this together. It can be accessed as intended [here](https://vasquez-a.github.io/vpan-heteroglossia/).
