they say you don't get a choice in your native language
-
this is not completely true
if your house is bilingual
-
and both english and spanish are all around you [razones1]
-
then you do have a choice
and the choice is probably english
-
so you let things like
-
[thing one]
-
[thing two]
-
[thing three]
-
fall to the wayside
-
but some of it sticks,
and shows up in places you wouldn't expect. [especial]
