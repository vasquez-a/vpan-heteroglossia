they say you don't get a choice in your native language
-
this is not really true
if your house is bilingual
-
and both english and spanish are all around you [razones1]
-
then you do have a choice
and the choice is probably english
-
so you let things like
-
[thing one]
-
[thing two]
-
[thing three]
-
fall to the wayside
-
but some of it sticks, [compendio]
and shows up in places you wouldn't expect. [especial]
---
a primary goal of world language education is real-life communication.
-
they give you a choice on what language you learn in the class
except often you don't really have one. [razones2]
-
and class cannot teach
your classmates to understand what your family's country says [azucar]
-
and class will not teach
you to speak the way your family does [fisno]
-
so you need the structure of a class to learn
-
but the most important things about the language
-
are what you learn
by listening in the car
or around the kitchen table [dique]
or on the porch
when you can barely follow what is happening
-
and the most important things about being dominican
you will never learn in a class
-
